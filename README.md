# Subtitle QC based on offset value from audio-sync

I had issues with subtitles being out of sync so I created (with 99% help from ChatGPT) this script that will auto-blacklist any subtitle that has been synced by more than +- 5 seconds.

My thought is that IF a subtitle is synced more than +-5 seconds there is something wrong with it and I would rather blacklist it and search for a new one.

After syncing 5000 subtitles my experience is: 

  - SOME files above +-5 seconds will produce a good sync.
  
  - ALMOST all files +- 20 seconds will produce a bad sync. 
  
That is why I set my limit at +-5 seconds. (you can set this in configuration)

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This will search for a new subtitle until the subtitles run out/you hit your predefind minimum score. So if your providers find 50 subtitles above your minimum score, this script will try everyone until it finds one +-5 seconds.

This script automates the blacklisting of downloaded subtitles in Bazarr.  
It checks:

- ‚úÖ Subtitle-to-video sync accuracy (based on Bazarr logs)
- ‚úÖ Detected subtitle language vs. expected language
- ‚úÖ Automatically blacklists out-of-sync (based on limit set) subtitles and start a search for new. (configurable acceptable amount)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When Bazarr downloads a subtitle, `postprocess.sh` is executed via the post-processing hook. It:

1. Exports subtitle metadata (IDs, language, file path).
2. Runs `extract_sync_offsets.py` with that context.
3. The Python script:
   - Reads Bazarr's SQLite DB for offset info.
   - Detects language of downloaded file (optional) and checks against bazarr if its correct.
   - If an offset of more than +-5 seconds is found, blacklists the subtitle using Bazarr's API and start a new search.

## üîß Setup

In Bazarr:
Enable: Automatic Subtitles Audio Synchronization
-  Series Score Threshold For Audio Sync: 100
-  Movies Score Threshold For Audio Sync: 100

Enable: Custom Post-Processing

Settings / Custom Post-Processing
 - Series Score Threshold For Post-Processing: 100
 - Movies Score Threshold For Post-Processing: 100
 - Command: /config/postprocess.sh "{{episode_id}}" "{{series_id}}" "{{provider}}" "{{subtitle_id}}" "{{subtitles_language_code2}}" "{{subtitles}}"

## üîß Configuration

Edit the top of `extract_sync_offsets.py` to adjust:

```python
ALLOWED_OFFSET_SECONDS = 5.0  # Max allowed offset (+/-) before blacklist occurs.
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here" # API key from Bazarr (settings/general).
API_HOST = "your_ip"
API_PORT = "6767"
DB_PATH = "/config/db/bazarr.db" #IF it does not find the .db, play around with this.

ENABLE_LOGGING = True                 # Log actions to file
ENABLE_LANGUAGE_DETECTION = True     # Detect language using guess_language
```

## üìÇ Files

- `extract_sync_offsets.py`: Main Python script that performs offset-extraction, blacklisting and language checks.
- `postprocess.sh`: Bash wrapper that passes arguments from Bazarr and triggers the Python script.
